Find a complete listing of programs and their associated prerequisites, or see the back of the Trent Viewbook, pages 64 - 66. The Medical Professional Stream is designed for students looking to pursue a career in a medical field after graduating from Trent. This stream is designed to give you a unique advantage in whatever medical path you choose by providing you with the academic and non-academic foundations that will best prepare you to be successful in your professional program examinations, applications and interviews. At the end of first year, you will select your desired degree major, but also continue in the Medical Professional Stream benefitting from the additional resources. These resources include MCAT Prep courses, Mock MCAT and DAT exams, Faculty Mentorship, Medical Interview prep workshops, etc. If you wish to set your major as Biomedical Science, Conservation Biology or Forensic Science and want to be in the Medical Professional Stream, apply to Biomedical Science or Forensic Science and email addmissions@trentu.ca to indicate your desire to also enroll in the Medical Professional Stream. Otherwise, you can apply directly to the Medical Professional Stream through the OUAC. If you are admitted to the Medical Professional Stream, then declare your major during your first year of study at Trent. An Autobiographical Sketch is due on February 1.
